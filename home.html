              <p>Codecademy has a huge selection of resources to teach yourself to code. Their catalog allows you to explore a variety of programming languages, especially for web development.
                You can find plenty of 100% free content on Codecademy. If you’re new to coding, you can easily sample different languages and tools with them. Try a few tutorials and exercise and see what you think. If you enjoy the classes and you feel like you’ve hit the jackpot, you can sign up for a paid plan to unlock more comprehensive, premium content.
                In case you’re not sure where to start, I’d suggest you go with the HTML and CSS modules. They’re easy and comparatively quick to learn. If it feels like fun, perhaps web design and web development is your thing?
                Codecademy was the first of all coding sites I tried as a beginner programmer. I loved how easy and fast it was to get started with them.

              <p>Codewars has a more gamified approach to learning how to code than most other platforms in this post. Their code challenges have a martial-arts theme, where the learning path is based on challenges called kata.<br>
                Each challenge aims at helping you either learn new skills or improve existing ones in a specific programming language. When you complete a kata, you’ll each honor points and get one step further towards higher ranks. With every kata you finish, the challenges will become tougher to solve.<br>              
                All in all, the kata system is a fun way to learn coding: Codewars is definitely one of the best websites to learn coding by gamification.

              <p>GA Dash is General Assembly’s free online web development learning platform. If you’re new to coding, you can use the free tutorials and interactive courses to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
                The best part? The courses are project-based, so you build small but practical web dev projects while working through the tutorials. You’ll start with some basic HTML and CSS to design and style beautiful, modern websites and landing pages.
                 Then, you’ll learn how to create interactive and dynamic interfaces with JavaScript.
